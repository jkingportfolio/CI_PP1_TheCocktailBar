### Fonts

There were 3 fonts used in this project, they are stated below:
- BIZ UDmincho with a backup of serif is the main font used throughout the website
- open sans with a backup of serif was used for the button styles

- A menu page, which lists all drinks available
- A gallery page, which consists of a showcase of images

## Features

In its entirety the website consists of five main pages, one 404 error page and 16 features, two of which have a mobile version and tablet / desktop version. 

### Existing features

#### Nav Bar 

- The navigation bar is featured on all five main pages and the error 404 page and includes 5 clickable links:

    - Home
    - About
    - Menu
    - Gallery
    - Contact

- It is fully resposive due to using the Bootstrap v5.0.2 nav bar which then produces a toggler menu for smaller screens. 
- The navigation bar is located at the top of every page in the same location and allows users to navigate seamlessly through the site.
- A hover effect on the text of the navigation bar text allows the user to understand that it is a clickable link. Upon clicking the link the user will be taken to the desired page

##### Desktop

#### Hero Image

When visiting the website and initially being directed to the home page the user is greeted by the hero image on both desktop and mobile.

- The hero image sets the scene of the site indicating that the website is for a cocktail bar
- The hero image also has a "zoom" effect to give the user a feeling of immersion into the website.

2. Once logged in navigate to the desired [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar) that you would like to fork.
3. At the top right corner of the page click on the fork icon.
4. There should now be a copy of your original repository in your Github account.

Please note if you are not a member of an organisation on GitHub then you will not be able to fork your own repository.

### Clone a GitHub Repository

You can make a local clone of a repository via the following steps: 

1. Navigate to www.github.com and log in.
2. Once logged in navigate to the desired [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkingportfolio/CI_PP1_TheCocktailBar) that you would like to clone.
