- Icons from Font Awesome are used in the site. As they are for decorative purposes only, Font Awesome already populates the code to be copied with an aria-hidden="true" attribute to accomodate accessibility.

### Performance

[Chrome dev tools lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test all pages for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO
